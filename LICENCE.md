% Description: 
% HEAL-T is MATLAB-based software designed to facilitate BVP+Accel signal
% processing and movement artifact (MA) removal in time using a Black-Harris Window (BHW) FIR filter dynamic bandwidth 
% and a frequency domain subtraction. 
% Users have the option to alter multiple settings, to customize processing to their needs.
